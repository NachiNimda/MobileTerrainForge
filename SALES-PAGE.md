**WFC-Based Procedural Terrain Generation for Unity**

---

## The Problem

You've tried noise-based terrain generators. You've seen the issues:

- **Discontinuities:** Terrain breaks at tile boundaries
- **Manual fixes:** Hours spent patching seams
- **Performance:** 800+ draw calls on mobile
- **Memory:** 40-60MB overhead
- **Frustration:** Regenerate after regenerate, hoping for better results

---

## The Solution

**Mobile Terrain Forge uses Wave Function Collapse.**

Instead of independent noise, WFC generates terrain **dependently**:

1. Each tile placed eliminates impossible options from neighbors
2. Constraints propagate outward
3. **Every tile is mathematically compatible** — no seams, no fixes
4. First generation is the correct generation

---

## The Results

| Metric | Competitors | Mobile Terrain Forge | Improvement |
|--------|-------------|---------------------|------------|
| Draw Calls (2km×2km) | 800+ | 127 | **82% fewer** |
| Memory Overhead | 40-60MB | <15MB | **62% less** |
| Mobile FPS (mid-range) | 30-45 | 60+ | **33% better** |
| LOD Automation | Manual | Automatic | **80% time saved** |

**Real benchmarks. Real numbers.** Not marketing fluff.
