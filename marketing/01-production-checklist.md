- [ ] Edit breaths and pauses for natural pacing
- [ ] Create backup takes for difficult sections

### Visual Asset Preparation
- [ ] Create WFC constraint diagrams (static)
- [ ] Animate wave function collapse visualization
- [ ] Generate before/after terrain comparison renders
- [ ] Prepare draw call comparison charts
- [ ] Create memory usage visualizations
- [ ] Design intro/outro title cards
- [ ] Prepare code snippet overlays
- [ ] Create performance metric overlays

## Production Phase

### Assembly
- [ ] Import voiceover to editing software
- [ ] Sync storyboard frames to narration timing
- [ ] Insert animated sequences at marked timestamps
- [ ] Layer code snippets during technical explanations
- [ ] Add performance metric overlays
- [ ] Apply intro and outro title cards

### Visual Polish
- [ ] Color grading for consistent palette (muted, professional)
- [ ] Smooth transitions between concept sections
- [ ] Ensure text overlays are readable at all zoom levels
- [ ] Verify animation timing matches narration pacing

- [ ] Verify all metrics displayed accurately
- [ ] Test on mobile device (60%+ viewers)
- [ ] Test on desktop for clarity
- [ ] Subtitle check for accessibility

### Thumbnail Creation
- [ ] Draft 3-5 thumbnail concepts
- [ ] Select strongest concept
- [ ] Create final thumbnail asset
- [ ] Test thumbnail at small sizes (YouTube recommendation)
- [ ] Ensure text is readable

### Metadata Preparation
- [ ] Write video title (compelling but honest)
- [ ] Draft description (2-3 paragraphs, SEO keywords)
- [ ] Select 5-8 relevant tags
- [ ] Create chapter timestamps
