### Video Title
**"Why Your Mobile Game is Drowning in Draw Calls (And the Dignified Solution)"**

### Tagline
**Refined Necessity for the Professional Developer**

---

### Opening (0:00-0:15)
*Visual: Split screen. Left side — chaotic, stuttering mobile terrain. Right side — smooth, flowing landscape at 60 FPS.*

**Voiceover:**
> "Every developer knows the feeling. You've crafted something beautiful, but your players are fighting their devices just to experience it. The stutter. The heat. the frustration."

> "This isn't how it should be."

---

### The Problem (0:15-0:45)
*Visual: Montage of terrain editors, cluttered interfaces, frustrated developer at desk.*

**Voiceover:**
> "The existing tools? They were built for desktop, where memory is abundant and draw calls are a minor concern. Transplant that philosophy to mobile, and you inherit their problems."

> "Manual LOD setup. Uncompressed splatmaps. Eight hundred draw calls for a single terrain. You spend hours sculpting, only to watch performance collapse when it matters most."

---

### The Philosophy (0:45-1:15)
*Visual: Elegant, minimal UI. Clean lines. The WFC algorithm solving tiles in real-time — mathematical, precise, beautiful.*

**Voiceover:**
> "We believe optimization isn't an afterthought. It's a foundation. A dignified stability that lets your art breathe, and your players immerse themselves without interruption."

> "Wave Function Collapse. A technique borrowed from quantum mechanics, now applied to terrain generation. Local consistency at every scale, automatically. No sculpting by hand. No fighting the engine."

---

### The Solution (1:15-2:00)
*Visual: 2km×2km terrain generating in seconds. LODs swapping smoothly. Splatmaps packing 8 channels cleanly. FPS counter holding steady at 60.*

**Voiceover:**
> "Mobile Terrain Forge. A refined necessity for the professional developer."

> "Automatic LOD swapping. Splatmap optimization. Eighty percent reduction in manual layout time. Your players won't notice the architecture — they'll simply enjoy a smoother experience."

> "That's the quiet craft. Efficiency that speaks through stability, not slogans."

---

### The Price (2:00-2:20)
*Visual: Clean title card with the tool name and price.*

**Voiceover:**
> "Mobile Terrain Forge. Coming soon to the Unity Asset Store."

> "A modest investment for developers who value their time, and their players' experience."

> "$59.99. Because professional tools deserve professional pricing."

---

### Closing (2:20-2:30)
*Visual: Subscribe button, channel name, social links.*

**Voiceover:**
> "Subscribe for the full devlog series. The quiet craft of optimization — from our studio to yours."

### Tone Guidelines for Brain B

**Voice:**
- Sophisticated, calm, confident
- Avoid hyperbole ("best," "amazing," "revolutionary")
- Use precise, measured language ("dignified," "refined," "necessity")
- When discussing competitors: respectful, factual, never disparaging

**Under Attack Protocol:**
- Acknowledge valid criticism with grace
- Redirect conversation to technical merit
- Avoid defensiveness; let performance speak
- Example: "You raise a fair point. Our benchmarking showed [data], which led us to [decision]. We remain committed to transparency."

**Visual Language:**
- Clean, minimal UI shots
- Technical diagrams (WFC constraints, LOD transitions)
- Benchmark data visualized elegantly
- No flashy animations — let the results shine
