- "Game-changing performance!" → Use: "Better performance, no compromises."
- "The best terrain system ever!" → Use: "Terrain done right."

### Why This Works:
- Builds trust through understatement
- Lets the technology speak for itself
- Appeals to sophisticated developers who see through hype
- Aligns with "The Quiet Craft of Optimization" brand
