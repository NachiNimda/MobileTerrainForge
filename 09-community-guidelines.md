# Community Guidelines

## Channel Philosophy

This channel is about technical excellence, not hype. We value:

- **Substance over style** — Ideas matter more than presentation
- **Correctness over shortcuts** — Do it right, not just quickly
- **Collaboration over competition** — We're all learning together
- **Respect over dominance** — Disagree thoughtfully, not aggressively

## Comment Quality Standards

### Good Comments
